                    <p>After a forced hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our research team was finally able to return to the field in July 2021. This expedition to Panchinala Glacier marked our first return to in-person glaciological research since late 2019, and the excitement among our team was palpable. Beyond the scientific goals, this journey represented a symbolic return to normalcy for our research program.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Navigating the Post-Pandemic Landscape</h2>
                    <p>Field research in remote areas presented unique challenges in a world still grappling with COVID-19. Our expedition planning had to incorporate numerous contingencies and safety protocols that had never been considerations in previous field seasons. The team underwent testing before departure and carried emergency supplies that would allow for isolation if needed.</p>
                    
                    <p>The logistics of international travel had also changed dramatically. With flights limited and entry requirements constantly evolving, getting our international collaborators to India required months of paperwork and coordination with various embassies. Despite these obstacles, we assembled a team of seven researchers, including glaciologists, hydrologists, and remote sensing specialists from India, Switzerland, and Nepal.</p>

                    <h2>Research Priorities After the Gap</h2>
                    <p>The 18-month interruption in our monitoring program created a significant data gap in our long-term glacier observations. Our primary objective was to re-establish our measurement network and assess changes that had occurred during our absence.</p>
                    
                    <p>Key research goals for this expedition included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Measuring changes in the glacier terminus position since our last observations</li>
                        <li>Re-establishing the ablation stake network for mass balance measurements</li>
                        <li>Conducting a comprehensive photogrammetric survey using drones to create a new digital elevation model</li>
                        <li>Installing automated weather stations that could continue data collection if future access were restricted</li>
                        <li>Collecting ice and water samples for isotopic and contaminant analysis</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The urgency of these measurements was heightened by climate models suggesting accelerated warming in the Himalayan region during 2020-2021, potentially leading to enhanced glacier melt that we needed to quantify.</p>

                    <h2>Journey to the Glacier</h2>
                    <p>Our expedition began in Delhi, where we finalized equipment preparations and conducted our final team briefings. From there, we traveled by road to Manali, a journey that took longer than usual due to COVID-related checkpoints and restrictions. After two days in Manali obtaining the necessary permits for the protected area where Panchinala is located, we began our trek.</p>
                    
                    <p>The approach to Panchinala Glacier follows the Parvati Valley, climbing through dense forests before opening into alpine meadows and eventually the rocky moraines that mark the glacier's historical extent. This trek typically takes three days, but with additional equipment for the extended research program, we scheduled four days for the ascent.</p>
                    
                    <p>As we moved higher into the valley, we were struck by visible changes in the landscape. Areas that had been under seasonal snow during our previous visit were now bare rock, and several small glacier-fed streams had changed their courses. These observations, even before reaching our primary research site, hinted at the significant changes we might document.</p>
                    
                    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-8">

                    <h2>First Impressions: Documenting Change</h2>
                    <p>Our first view of Panchinala Glacier came on the fourth day of trekking, as we crested a ridge that overlooks the glacier basin. The collective gasp from the team members who had seen the glacier before told its own story. The terminus had retreated significantly, exposing a new proglacial lake that had not existed during our 2019 visit.</p>
                    
                    <p>We established our base camp on a stable lateral moraine at approximately 4,100 meters elevation, providing a good vantage point for our initial observations. Preliminary measurements using ground control points from our previous expeditions suggested that the glacier terminus had retreated approximately 41 meters in 18 months—a rate that far exceeded our historical measurements of 12-15 meters per year.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        Standing at the viewpoint where I had taken photos in 2019, I now had to adjust my camera position significantly just to capture the current terminus. The scale of change was both scientifically fascinating and personally alarming.
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>The surface of the glacier also showed enhanced melt features, with larger supraglacial ponds and more extensively developed drainage channels than we had documented previously. The ablation zone had expanded upward in elevation by approximately 150 meters, indicating a significant shift in the glacier's mass balance regime.</p>
                    
                    <img src="../images/gallery/fulls/Panchinala 2021/IMG_3301.JPG" alt="View of the retreated glacier terminus with new proglacial lake" class="w-full my-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
                    
                    <h2>Rebuilding the Measurement Network</h2>
                    <p>Many of our previous measurement stakes had been lost due to enhanced melting, requiring us to establish a new network. We installed 22 ablation stakes across the glacier surface, positioned to capture the spatial variability in melt rates. Each stake was geolocation with differential GPS to allow precise measurement of ice velocity in addition to surface lowering.</p>
                    
                    <p>The process of drilling holes for these stakes revealed ice thicknesses ranging from 1.5 meters near the terminus to over 25 meters in the upper ablation zone. Comparing these measurements with ground-penetrating radar surveys from 2018 indicated thinning of 3-5 meters in some locations—a substantial loss of ice mass in just three years.</p>
                    
                    <p>We also established a network of ground control points on stable terrain surrounding the glacier to serve as references for future remote sensing analyses. These markers, visible from satellite imagery, will allow us to continue monitoring certain aspects of glacier change even if field access becomes restricted again.</p>

                    <h2>Technological Adaptations</h2>
                    <p>The pandemic-induced pause in our research program prompted us to accelerate the adoption of new technologies that could provide data continuity even with limited field access. We deployed two automated weather stations equipped with satellite data transmission capabilities, allowing year-round monitoring of meteorological conditions affecting the glacier.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our drone survey methodology also evolved significantly. Previous expeditions had used basic photogrammetry, but for this mission, we employed RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) GPS-enabled drones that could deliver centimeter-level accuracy in their elevation models. These systems allowed us to create detailed 3D maps of the glacier surface that will serve as critical baseline data for future change assessments.</p>
                    
                    <p>We also tested a new network of low-cost time-lapse cameras that could capture daily images of the glacier terminus throughout the year. These solar-powered units, installed on stable bedrock outcrops, would continue collecting data long after our departure, providing insights into seasonal dynamics that had previously been difficult to monitor.</p>

                    <h2>Hydrological Monitoring</h2>
                    <p>A major focus of the 2021 expedition was expanding our hydrological research component. The newly formed proglacial lake represented both a research opportunity and a potential hazard for downstream communities, and understanding its dynamics became a priority.</p>
                    
                    <p>We installed water level sensors at the lake outlet and at three points downstream to monitor discharge patterns and potential flood events. Water samples collected at these stations revealed significant levels of suspended sediment—an indicator of active erosion beneath the glacier that often accompanies periods of enhanced melt.</p>
                    
                    <p>Mapping of the lake bathymetry revealed a maximum depth of 28 meters near the current ice terminus, with a total storage volume of approximately 1.2 million cubic meters. This volume represents a potential hazard if the lake were to drain rapidly, necessitating the development of monitoring protocols that we shared with local authorities.</p>

                    <h2>Community Science and Local Engagement</h2>
                    <p>The prolonged absence of research teams in the region had created concerns among local communities about the status of their water sources. We organized informal workshops in two downstream villages to share our preliminary findings and discuss the implications of glacier change for water security.</p>
                    
                    <p>These interactions evolved into a community science initiative, with several local residents volunteering to collect periodic observations using protocols we developed. We provided basic training in photographic documentation, water level monitoring, and weather observations that could complement our automated systems and fill potential gaps between research expeditions.</p>
                    
                    <p>This collaborative approach not only expanded our monitoring capabilities but also strengthened relationships with communities that had sometimes viewed outside researchers with skepticism. By incorporating local knowledge about historical glacier extents and river behavior, we gained valuable context for interpreting our instrumental data.</p>

                    <h2>Preliminary Findings and Implications</h2>
                    <p>The data collected during our three-week field campaign painted a concerning picture of accelerated glacier change. The enhanced retreat rate, formation of the proglacial lake, and measured thinning all pointed to a system experiencing rapid adjustment to changing climate conditions.</p>
                    
                    <p>Particularly notable was the expansion of the ablation zone to higher elevations, suggesting that the glacier's accumulation area ratio (AAR) had decreased significantly. This metric, which represents the proportion of a glacier that gains mass through snowfall each year, is a key indicator of glacier health. Our measurements suggested an AAR of just 0.35, well below the 0.6-0.7 range that typically indicates a glacier in equilibrium with its climate.</p>
                    
                    <p>The implications of these changes extend beyond the glacier itself. Downstream communities rely on meltwater from Panchinala for irrigation and domestic use, particularly during pre-monsoon months when other water sources are limited. Our hydrological models suggest that while meltwater discharge may increase in the short term due to enhanced ablation, the long-term prognosis indicates potential water scarcity as the glacier's ice reserves diminish.</p>

                    <h2>Looking Forward: Adapting Research in Uncertain Times</h2>
                    <p>As we completed our field campaign and began the journey back to civilization, our team discussions focused on how to adapt our research program to the realities of a world where international travel and field access might remain unpredictable. Several key strategies emerged from these conversations:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Expanding our network of automated monitoring systems to provide data continuity between field visits</li>
                        <li>Strengthening partnerships with local researchers and communities who can maintain basic monitoring when international travel is restricted</li>
                        <li>Developing more sophisticated remote sensing methodologies that can extract detailed glacier information from satellite data</li>
                        <li>Creating flexible research plans with tiered objectives that can adapt to varying levels of field access</li>
                        <li>Building more robust data management systems that enable effective collaboration among distributed research teams</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>These adaptations, while driven by the immediate challenges of the pandemic, have broader implications for how we conduct glaciological research in remote areas. By diversifying our methodological toolkit and embracing collaborative approaches, we can build more resilient research programs capable of maintaining critical climate records even in uncertain times.</p>

                    <p>As we descended from Panchinala with our equipment and data, the glacier receded behind us—smaller than when we had last seen it, but still magnificent in its stark beauty. Our return to this landscape after a forced absence reinforced the privilege and responsibility of documenting these dynamic environments as they respond to global change.</p>
                    
                    <p>The 2021 Panchinala expedition may have been shaped by the practical challenges of conducting research during a pandemic, but it ultimately reinforced the fundamental importance of field observations in understanding our changing cryosphere. As we analyze the data collected during this campaign and prepare for future field seasons, we carry both the scientific insights and the adaptability lessons forward into our evolving research program.</p>
