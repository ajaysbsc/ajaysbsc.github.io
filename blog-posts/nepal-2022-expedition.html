                    <p>December 2022 marked our collaborative expedition to the Langtang Valley in Nepal, a region known for its stunning Himalayan landscapes and critically important glacier systems. This expedition built upon our previous research in the Indian Himalaya with the goal of establishing comparative datasets across transboundary mountain systems. The Langtang Valley, with its accessibility and well-documented glacial history, provided an ideal site for expanding our research framework.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Research Objectives in a Transboundary Context</h2>
                    <p>Our expedition to Nepal represented an important step in developing a regional understanding of glacier dynamics. By extending our research beyond national boundaries, we aimed to create a more comprehensive picture of how climate change is affecting the broader Himalayan region. The primary research objectives for this expedition included:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Comparative analysis of debris-covered glacier dynamics between Nepalese and Indian Himalayan glaciers</li>
                        <li>Assessment of meltwater contribution to local water resources in the Langtang watershed</li>
                        <li>Application of our remote sensing validation protocols in a new geographic context</li>
                        <li>Strengthening collaborative relationships with Nepalese research institutions and local communities</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The timing of our expedition in December also allowed us to observe early winter conditions and snow accumulation patterns, providing insights into the seasonal transition that is often missed in summer-focused research campaigns.</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <h2>Journey to Langtang</h2>
                    <p>Our expedition began in Kathmandu, where we met with colleagues from Tribhuvan University to finalize our research protocols and obtain the necessary permits. The journey to Langtang required an 8-hour drive to Syabrubesi, followed by a three-day trek into the valley. This approach gave us time to acclimate to the elevation while making preliminary observations of the changing landscape.</p>
                    
                    <p>The trek into Langtang Valley provided a sobering reminder of the 2015 earthquake's devastating impact. The village of Langtang, which was completely destroyed by an avalanche triggered by the earthquake, has been partially rebuilt, but evidence of the disaster remains visible throughout the landscape. Local guides shared their experiences from that day, emphasizing the ongoing environmental hazards that communities in this region face—hazards that may be exacerbated by climate-induced changes in glacier stability.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The resilience of these communities in the face of such catastrophic events is remarkable. Their knowledge of landscape changes over decades provides an invaluable complement to our instrumental data.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>As we moved higher into the valley, the December temperatures dropped significantly, with nighttime readings often below -15°C. This cold snap presented challenges for our equipment but offered excellent conditions for observing winter processes in the glacial environment.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Field Methods and Data Collection</h2>
                    <p>Our research in Langtang Valley focused on the Lirung Glacier, a relatively accessible debris-covered glacier that has been the subject of previous scientific investigations. This existing research baseline allowed us to place our measurements in a historical context and contribute to long-term monitoring efforts.</p>
                    
                    <p>The field campaign employed several complementary methods:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Structure-from-Motion Photogrammetry</h3>
                    <p>Using our UAV-based imaging system, we conducted detailed photogrammetric surveys of portions of Lirung Glacier. The early winter conditions, with light snow cover highlighting surface features, proved ideal for capturing surface topography. These surveys will allow us to create high-resolution digital elevation models for comparison with both our previous work in India and with historical data from Lirung.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Surface Temperature Mapping</h3>
                    <p>We deployed thermal imaging cameras to map surface temperature variations across the debris-covered portions of the glacier. The winter conditions provided an excellent opportunity to observe how different debris thicknesses affect the thermal regime of the ice below—a critical factor in understanding differential melt patterns.</p>

                    <h3>Meltwater Hydrochemistry</h3>
                    <p>Although winter is typically a low-flow period for glacier-fed streams, we collected water samples from the proglacial stream system for analysis of dissolved solutes and environmental DNA. These samples will help characterize the winter baseline conditions and contribute to our understanding of year-round hydrological processes.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Community Knowledge Integration</h3>
                    <p>Throughout our time in Langtang, we conducted informal interviews with local residents to document their observations of environmental change. These conversations revealed consistent reports of decreasing winter snowfall, changes in meltwater availability, and shifting patterns of vegetation growth at higher elevations—all indicators of climate-driven changes that complement our instrumental measurements.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Comparative Insights: Nepal vs. Indian Himalaya</h2>
                    <p>One of the most valuable aspects of this expedition was the opportunity to make direct comparisons between our Langtang observations and our previous work in the Indian Himalaya. Several key differences emerged that highlight the importance of regional studies in glaciology:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Debris Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>The debris cover on Lirung Glacier differs notably from what we've observed on Panchinala and other Indian Himalayan glaciers. In Langtang, the debris layer tends to be thinner on average and contains a higher proportion of fine-grained material. These differences significantly affect melt dynamics and likely contribute to different rates of glacier evolution between the regions.</p>
                    
                    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-8">
                        <img src="../images/gallery/fulls/Nepal Dec 2022/IMG_20221207_070408.jpg" alt="Debris composition analysis" class="rounded-lg shadow-md">
                        <img src="../images/gallery/fulls/Nepal Dec 2022/IMG_20221213_110055.jpg" alt="Close-up of glacier debris" class="rounded-lg shadow-md">
                    </div>
                    
                    <h3>Ice Cliff Morphology</h3>
                    <p>Ice cliffs—steep exposed ice faces within debris-covered glaciers—play a crucial role in overall ablation dynamics. Our observations at Lirung revealed a different distribution pattern of these features compared to our Indian study sites. The Langtang cliffs tend to be more numerous but smaller in size, potentially leading to different spatial patterns of mass loss.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Human Interaction with Glacier Systems</h3>
                    <p>The patterns of human-glacier interaction also differ significantly between regions. The Langtang Valley, with its established trekking routes and recovering tourism economy, experiences different types of human impact than the more remote Indian sites. These differences in human presence and activity affect both the physical environment and the available infrastructure for long-term monitoring.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Technological Adaptations for Winter Research</h2>
                    <p>Conducting research in winter conditions required several adaptations to our standard field methods. The extreme cold affected battery performance in most of our electronic equipment, necessitating careful power management and insulation strategies. We developed several innovative approaches to address these challenges:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Custom battery warming systems using chemical heat packs for UAV operations</li>
                        <li>Modified sampling protocols for water collection to prevent freezing during processing</li>
                        <li>Adapted survey protocols with shorter flight durations but higher frequency to manage battery limitations</li>
                        <li>Specialized equipment protection for nighttime condensation issues when bringing cold equipment into warmer shelters</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>These winter-specific adaptations yielded valuable insights that will inform future cold-weather campaigns, including our Antarctic expeditions where similar challenges exist at a more extreme level.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Collaborative Research Framework</h2>
                    <p>A central goal of this expedition was strengthening our collaborative network with Nepalese researchers and institutions. Working alongside colleagues from Tribhuvan University and the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), we established protocols for data sharing and joint analysis that will continue beyond the fieldwork phase.</p>
                    
                    <p>This collaboration has already led to plans for a more extensive joint expedition in 2023, which will expand our research to additional glacier systems in the Langtang region and incorporate complementary expertise from our Nepalese colleagues in areas such as social hydrology and climate adaptation strategies.</p>

                    <h2>Preliminary Findings and Future Directions</h2>
                    <p>Although detailed analysis of our field data is ongoing, several preliminary findings have emerged from the December 2022 expedition that will guide our future research:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Winter Accumulation Patterns</h3>
                    <p>Our observations suggest that winter snowfall in the region has been declining in recent years, as reported by local residents and evidenced by the limited snow cover we observed even at higher elevations in December. This trend has significant implications for annual mass balance and water resources, as reduced winter accumulation amplifies the effects of summer melt.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Debris Evolution</h3>
                    <p>The characteristics of supraglacial debris appear to be evolving over time, with increasing proportions of fine material being deposited on glacier surfaces. This change may be linked to increased freeze-thaw weathering of surrounding slopes as permafrost thaws in the warming climate. The changing debris composition has direct implications for melt rates beneath the debris layer.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Regional Data Gaps</h3>
                    <p>Our comparative work has highlighted significant regional variations in glacier behavior that are not fully captured in large-scale remote sensing studies. This underscores the importance of maintaining a network of field-validated sites across the Himalayan region rather than relying on extrapolation from limited areas.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                    <p>Building on the success of this expedition, we have developed plans for several follow-up activities:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>A comprehensive comparative analysis of debris characteristics between our Nepal and India study sites, including detailed material composition, thermal properties, and thickness distributions</li>
                        <li>Integration of our field measurements with remote sensing data to validate satellite-derived estimates of winter snow accumulation</li>
                        <li>Development of shared protocols for citizen science initiatives that can help maintain observational continuity between research expeditions</li>
                        <li>Expansion of our winter campaign approach to additional regions, including plans for winter observations in Bhutan in 2023-2024</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>Conclusion: The Value of Winter Observations</h2>
                    <p>The December 2022 expedition to Langtang Valley has highlighted the critical importance of winter observations in mountain cryosphere research. While most field campaigns focus on summer ablation periods, understanding the winter accumulation phase and cold-season processes is equally essential for a complete picture of glacier health and evolution.</p>
                    
                    <p>By expanding our research temporally (into the winter season) and spatially (across national boundaries), we are developing a more comprehensive understanding of how Himalayan glacier systems are responding to climate change. This broader perspective is essential for predicting future changes in water resources and developing appropriate adaptation strategies for mountain communities.</p>
                    
                    <p>As we analyze the data collected during this expedition and integrate it with our existing research framework, we continue to build a more nuanced understanding of glacier dynamics in High Mountain Asia. The insights gained from this transboundary, multi-season approach will inform both our scientific publications and our ongoing engagement with policy discussions around climate adaptation in mountain regions.</p>
